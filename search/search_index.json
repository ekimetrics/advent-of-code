The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. \"Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!\" You ask if you can take a look. Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen. To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set. For example, suppose you have the following list: 1-3 a: abcde 1-3 b: cdefg 2-9 c: ccccccccc Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times. In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the limits of their respective policies.

While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees. Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example: ..##....... #...#...#.. .#....#..#. ..#.#...#.# .#...##..#. ..#.##..... .#.#.#....# .#........# #.##...#... #...##....# .#..#...#.# These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---> #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---> .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---> You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map). The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1: From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map. The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree: ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---> #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---> .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---> In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.
