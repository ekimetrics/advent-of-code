The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. \"Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!\" You ask if you can take a look. Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen. To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set. For example, suppose you have the following list: 1-3 a: abcde 1-3 b: cdefg 2-9 c: ccccccccc Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times. In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the limits of their respective policies.

While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees. Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example: ..##....... #...#...#.. .#....#..#. ..#.#...#.# .#...##..#. ..#.##..... .#.#.#....# .#........# #.##...#... #...##....# .#..#...#.# These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---> #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---> .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---> You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map). The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1: From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map. The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree: ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---> #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---> .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---> In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.

The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1: From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map. The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree: ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---> #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---> .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---> In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees. Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter? https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3","title":"Problem"},{"location":"tutorials/day3/#solution-1","text":"","title":"Solution 1"},{"location":"tutorials/day3/#tip","text":"You can use numpy here to avoid doing loops.

While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world. It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary. Due to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to solve both of these problems at the same time. The automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble detecting which passports have all required fields. The expected fields are as follows: byr (Birth Year) iyr (Issue Year) eyr (Expiration Year) hgt (Height) hcl (Hair Color) ecl (Eye Color) pid (Passport ID) cid (Country ID) Passport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport is represented as a sequence of key:value pairs separated by spaces or newlines. Passports are separated by blank lines. Here is an example batch file containing four passports: ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884 hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929 hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013 eyr:2024 ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931 hgt:179cm hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648 iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in The first passport is valid - all eight fields are present. The second passport is invalid - it is missing hgt (the Height field). The third passport is interesting; the only missing field is cid, so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing cid fields. Treat this \"passport\" as valid. The fourth passport is missing two fields, cid and byr. Missing cid is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is invalid. According to the above rules, your improved system would report 2 valid passports. Count the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields. Treat cid as optional.
